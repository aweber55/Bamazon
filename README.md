# My Bamazon Store Front


#### OverView
-------------------------------------------------
##### In this project, I utilized the MySQL and NPM Node packages such as Inquirer and Cli-table. The purpose of the app is to act as a virtual store front and allows customers to view the products available, as well as the price and inventory amount. The customer is then able to purchase the item they want and the amount they desire. Using the MySQL database, the purchase is fullfilled and the response is the total ordered and the price paid as well as the database is refreshed automatically.
